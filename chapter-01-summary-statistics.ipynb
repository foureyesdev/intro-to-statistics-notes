    "# 📊 Chapter 01: Summary Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll learn how to describe and interpret data using summary statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation, and develop the skills to choose the right ones for different situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 What is Statistics?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistics** is the science of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data.  \n",
    "It helps us make sense of the world through numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Main Branches:\n",
    "- **Descriptive Statistics** – Summarize or describe features of a dataset.\n",
    "- **Inferential Statistics** – Make predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📈 Why Statistics Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Stats are everywhere—sports, finance, healthcare, government, science.  \n",
    "They answer real-world questions like:\n",
    "- What’s the average salary?\n",
    "- Do ads affect purchases?\n",
    "- Is a new vaccine effective?\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Limitations of Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only answers **measurable, well-defined** questions.\n",
    "- Tells you **what** is happening and **how often**, not **why** it’s happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔢 Types of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Numeric Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Continuous**: Infinite values within a range (e.g., stock prices).\n",
    "- **Interval/Count**: Whole numbers (e.g., cups of coffee per day).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Categorical Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nominal**: No natural order (e.g., eye color, brands).\n",
    "- **Ordinal**: Ordered categories (e.g., satisfaction ratings).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Data Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Visuals help explore and communicate insights. Pick the right chart for your data type:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Chart Type | Purpose                                    | Data Type   | Best For                                           | Example                          |\n",
    "|------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n",
    "| Bar Chart  | Compare values across **categories**       | Categorical | Highlighting highs/lows, discrete comparisons      | Sales by product type            |\n",
    "| Histogram  | Show the **distribution** of data          | Continuous  | Detecting skew, peaks, and spread                  | Age distribution in a population |\n",
    "| Box Plot   | Show spread & **identify outliers**        | Continuous  | Comparing distributions across groups              | Salary ranges by department      |\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📍Measures of Center\n",
    "\n",
    "These help find the “typical” value in your dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mean** – Arithmetic average\n",
    "- **Median** – Middle value\n",
    "- **Mode** – Most frequent value\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Use the **Mean** when:\n",
    "- Data is **symmetric** (bell-shaped).\n",
    "- You care about **all values** equally.\n",
    "- There are **no extreme outliers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 _Example_: Average test score in a balanced classroom.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤔 Use the **Median** when:\n",
    "- Data is **skewed** (e.g., income, housing prices).\n",
    "- You want a **typical** value that’s not affected by outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 _Example_: Median income in a city with billionaires and broke students.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 😎 Use the **Mode** when:\n",
    "- Data is **categorical** or **discrete**.\n",
    "- You're looking for the **most common** value.\n",
    "- You have **bimodal/multimodal** data.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 _Example_: Most popular ice cream flavor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧪 Quick Test\n",
    "\n",
    "| Scenario                    | Best Measure |\n",
    "|----------------------------|--------------|\n",
    "| No outliers, symmetric     | Mean         |\n",
    "| Outliers or skewed data    | Median       |\n",
    "| Categorical or most frequent | Mode       |\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌊 Measures of Spread\n",
    "\n",
    "These describe how **spread out** or **varied** the data is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Range** = Max − Min  \n",
    "- **Variance** = Average of squared deviations from the mean  \n",
    "- **Standard Deviation (SD)** = Square root of variance  \n",
    "- **Quartiles & IQR (Interquartile Range)**:\n",
    "   - Divides data into four equal parts\n",
    "   - **IQR = Q3 − Q1** → Helps avoid distortion from outliers\n"
