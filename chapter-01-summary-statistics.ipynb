    "## 🔍 What is Statistics?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistics** is the science of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data.  \n",
    "It helps us make sense of the world through numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Main Branches:\n",
    "- **Descriptive Statistics** – Summarize or describe features of a dataset.\n",
    "- **Inferential Statistics** – Make predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"why-statistics-matter\"></a>\n",
    "## 📈 Why Statistics Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Stats are everywhere—sports, finance, healthcare, government, science.  \n",
    "They answer real-world questions like:\n",
    "- What’s the average salary?\n",
    "- Do ads affect purchases?\n",
    "- Is a new vaccine effective?\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"limitations-of-statistics\"></a>\n",
    "## ⚠️ Limitations of Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only answers **measurable, well-defined** questions.\n",
    "- Tells you **what** is happening and **how often**, not **why** it’s happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"types-of-data\"></a>\n",
    "## 🔢 Types of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"numeric-data\"></a>\n",
    "### **Numeric Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Continuous**: Infinite values within a range (e.g., stock prices).\n",
    "- **Interval/Count**: Whole numbers (e.g., cups of coffee per day).\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"categorical-data\"></a>\n",
    "### **Categorical Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nominal**: No natural order (e.g., eye color, brands).\n",
    "- **Ordinal**: Ordered categories (e.g., satisfaction ratings).\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"data-visualization\"></a>\n",
    "## 📊 Data Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Visuals help explore and communicate insights. Pick the right chart for your data type:\n",

    "## 📍Measures of Center\n",
    "\n",
    "These help find the “typical” value in your dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mean** – Arithmetic average\n",
    "- **Median** – Middle value\n",

    "### 🧠 Use the **Mean** when:\n",
    "- Data is **symmetric** (bell-shaped).\n",
    "- You care about **all values** equally.\n",
    "- There are **no extreme outliers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 _Example_: Average test score in a balanced classroom.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"use-the-median-when\"></a>\n",
    "### 🤔 Use the **Median** when:\n",
    "- Data is **skewed** (e.g., income, housing prices).\n",
    "- You want a **typical** value that’s not affected by outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 _Example_: Median income in a city with billionaires and broke students.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"use-the-mode-when\"></a>\n",
    "### 😎 Use the **Mode** when:\n",
    "- Data is **categorical** or **discrete**.\n",
    "- You're looking for the **most common** value.\n",
    "- You have **bimodal/multimodal** data.\n",

    "- **Range** = Max − Min  \n",
