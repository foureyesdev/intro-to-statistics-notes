    "# üìä Chapter 04: Correlation and Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you'll explore hypothesis testing to draw accurate conclusions about populations, understand correlation to measure linear relationships, learn experimental design techniques like randomization and blinding, and discover methods to reduce errors in hypothesis test results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîç What is Hypothesis Testing?\n",
    "Hypothesis testing helps compare populations using sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world Examples**:\n",
    "- Does changing a price increase revenue?\n",
    "- Is a medication effective?\n",
    "- Does changing a URL increase traffic?\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß† The Basics\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)**: Assumes no difference or effect.\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ)**: Assumes a difference or effect exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- H‚ÇÄ: No difference in birth gender ratio between women who do and do not take vitamin C.\n",
    "- H‚ÇÅ: There is a difference (e.g., more females born among those who take vitamin C).\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚öôÔ∏è Hypothesis Testing Workflow\n",
    "1. Define the target populations\n",
    "2. Formulate null and alternative hypotheses\n",
    "3. Collect sample data\n",
    "4. Perform statistical tests\n",
    "5. Draw conclusions about the population\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìà Sample Size & Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "- Larger samples ‚Üí more accurate estimates\n",
    "- Use past research to estimate needed sample size\n",
    "- **Central Limit Theorem**: Sample means approach the population mean as n increases\n",
    "\n",
    "## Independent and dependent variables\n",
    "- **Independent Variable**: Unaffected by other data (e.g., vitamin C)\n",
    "- **Dependent Variable**: Affected by other data (e.g., gender ratio)\n",
    "- Commonly used to describe hypothesis test results\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß™ Experiments, treatment, and control\n",
    "- Experiments are a subset of hypothesis testing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Experiments aim to answer: What is the effect of the treatment on the response?\n",
    "  - **Treatment**: independent variable\n",
    "  - **Response**: dependent variable\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the effect of an advertisement on the number of products purchased?\n",
    "  - **Treatment**: advertisement\n",
    "  - **Response**: number of products purchased\n",
    "\n",
    "- Participants are assigned to either the treatment group or the control group\n",
    "  - **Treatment group** sees the advertisement\n",
    "  - **Control group** does not see the advertisement\n",
    "- Groups should be comparable to avoid introducing bias\n",
    "- If groups are not comparable, this could lead to drawing incorrect conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "## ü•á The Gold Standard: RCTs\n",
    "- **Randomization**: Randomly assign to groups\n",
    "- **Blinding**: Participants don‚Äôt know their group\n",
    "- **Double-blind**: Neither participants nor administrators know who gets the real treatment\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fewer opportunities for bias = more reliable conclusion about causation**\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß™ A/B Testing vs. RCT\n",
    "- **A/B Testing**: Two groups (popular in marketing/tech)\n",
    "- **RCT**: May have multiple treatment groups (common in science/healthcare)\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîó Correlation\n",
    "- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r)**:\n",
    "  - Ranges from -1 to +1\n",
    "  - Magnitude = strength of relationship\n",
    "  - Sign = direction of relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**:\n",
    "- `r = 0.99`: Very strong\n",
    "- `r = 0.56`: Moderate\n",
    "- `r = 0.04`: None\n",
    "\n",
    "> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Correlation ‚â† Causation**\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚ö†Ô∏è Confounding Variables\n",
    "Unmeasured factors may distort the observed relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- Countries with higher water costs may also have better healthcare ‚Üí confounding variable: **economic strength**\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß† Interpreting Hypothesis Test Results\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a hypothesis test, you're investigating whether a claim about a population is likely true based on sample data. You start with two opposing ideas:\n",
    "- Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ): \"Nothing‚Äôs going on here.\" It‚Äôs the status quo. No difference. No effect.\n",
    "- Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ or Ha): \"Something‚Äôs fishy.\" It suggests there is a difference or effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Testing if life expectancy in Chicago is different from Bangkok.\n",
    "  - H‚ÇÄ: No difference in life expectancy.\n",
    "  - H‚ÇÅ: Chicago residents live longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ p-value\n",
    "\n",
    "The p-value is the probability of getting a result as extreme or more extreme than what you observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "![p-value](./assets/overlap.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**:\n",
    "  - Low p-value (typically ‚â§ 0.05): \"Whoa, this result is too rare under the null. Let's reject H‚ÇÄ.\"\n",
    "  - High p-value (> 0.05): \"Meh, this result could easily happen even if H‚ÇÄ is true. Let‚Äôs keep H‚ÇÄ.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### üö® Significance Level (Œ±)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before peeking at your data, you pick a significance level (usually Œ± = 0.05). This is your risk tolerance‚Äîthe chance you're willing to take of being wrong when rejecting the null.\n",
    "\n",
    "If:\n",
    "  - p ‚â§ Œ± ‚Üí Reject the null ‚Üí \"Statistically significant!\"\n",
    "  - p > Œ± ‚Üí Fail to reject the null ‚Üí \"Not enough evidence.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìù Drawing a Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Let‚Äôs say we tested life expectancy in Chicago vs. Bangkok.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - We got a p-value of 0.037\n",
    "  - Our Œ± was 0.05\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result**: Since 0.037 ‚â§ 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**: There‚Äôs statistically significant evidence that Chicagoans live longer than Bangkokians."
